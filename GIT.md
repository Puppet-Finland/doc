Working with Git
================

Git configuration
-----------------

Git options *user.name* and *user.email* should be configured, so that a Signed-Off-By line can be added with *-s* switch to git-commit.

The commit message should be of the following format:

    Summary of the change in 80 chars or less

    Optional detailed, multi-line description, each line 80 chars or less  

    Signed-off-by: User Name <user@domain.com>

A real-life example:

    Added the possibility to allow traffic from an additional IPv4 address/subnet

    Previously only the IPv4 addresses reported by the Filedaemons were allowed to
    contact the Storagedaemon. Sometimes this does not work, but the new
    $allow_additional_ipv4_address parameter can defined to work around this issue.

    Signed-off-by: Samuli Sepp√§nen <samuli@openvpn.net>

The purpose of the Signed-Off-By lines is to identify the author(s) of the changes.

Using Git submodules
--------------------

Each Puppet module should be a Git submodule for a number of reasons:

* Puppet modules are typically in separate Git repositories anyways
* Git submodules can be managed efficiently with built-in Git tools, unlike separate Git repositories
* Adding, removing and replacing individual modules is easy
* Each site can include only those modules which it really needs

Using external Puppet modules
-----------------------------

If you're using external Puppet modules it's advisable to fork them first and 
then use the fork. This ensures that changes to these modules at the upstream 
source do not accidentally break your nodes.

My recommendation is to only use modules which are simple enough to review and 
validate in a reasonable time. This rules out many complex, yet high-level 
modules such as "puppetlabs/postgresql" and "puppetlabs/puppetdb". In my 
experience those modules do not usually work regardless of what OS support they 
claim. Even if they work initially, they tend to break in updates. Their 
"master" or development branches are also in constant flux, which may cause 
unexpected issues and makes reviewing changes tiresome. These are probably 
inherent properties of large modules which try to support every possible 
use-case. In any case, these modules are probably more high-maintenance than 
your own custom module which does exactly what you need and nothing more. 
Modules which consist mostly of types and providers (e.g. puppetlabs/apt) seem 
to be more stable and much more useful.

While the Puppet Forge is in theory quite useful, I suggest only fetching 
providers and functions from there. The reason is that Git allows proper review 
of changes _before_ they are pulled in to your environment. In addition using 
Git will allow you to provide patches to the original module author more easily 
when necessary.

Symbolic links
--------------

Oftentimes the Git repository name is different fron the Puppet module name. For 
example "puppetlabs-git" contains a Puppet module called "git". To prevent 
namespace clashes it's useful to clone the Git repository as is, then make a 
symbolic link to the directory so that Puppet module autoloader can find it:

    $ git submodule add https://github.com/Puppet-Finland/puppetlabs-git.git
    $ ln -s puppetlabs-git git

If you want to switch to another Git module later on you can simply replace the 
symbolic link.

Tagging versions
----------------

It is recommended to add a Git tag for each module version. For example, if at 
some commit you set the module version to 0.5.3 in metadata.json, you should add 
a matching Git tag after the commit:

    $ git tag -a v0.5.3 -m "Version 0.5.3"

This way tracking versions becomes much easier.

Merging changes from upstream
-----------------------------

To merge changes from an upstream repository to your own fork follow the instructions on GitHub:

* https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/
* https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

Rebasing modules
----------------

The goal of the Puppet-Finland project is to produce a consistent and reusable 
set of Puppet modules which can be used for most purposes without any 
modifications. What this means is that all sites/environments will be using the 
same set of modules and that modules on all sites will be kept updated with 
upstream. In this case upstream means the status of modules in Puppet-Finland 
GitHub project.

Because the same modules are used on all sites the modules need to be rebased 
from Puppet-Finland on a regular basis. If the Puppet modules are Git submodules 
as recommended above, reviewing the changes is fairly easy.

    $ git submodule foreach "git fetch"
    $ git submodule foreach "git show master..origin"

If the changes look innocent you can rebase the modules with upstream:

    $ git submodule foreach "git pull --rebase origin"

Puppet-Finland modules that are based on upstream modules need to be rebased 
periodically. The first time you do this add "upstream" as a remote:

    $ git remote add <upstream-git-repo-url>

Once this is taken care off fetch the changes from upstream, review them and 
then rebase:

    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git show master..upstream/master
    $ git rebase upstream/master
